about_title: Our Supper Club = Real Food
about_text: We all love eating out, but when you're health concious eating out in London isn't so easy.  I've literally blown waiters minds with my substitutions.. "Yes, I want the burger - but without the bun".  And who's ever left a restaurant feeling lighter & more energetic than when they went in?? (I blame the vegetable oils personally)  That's why we started the Real Food supper club.
#<br><br>Nothing is from a packet, there's no sugar, no gluten*, no soy*, no vegtable oils are used, no grains & minimal carbs.  I know, I know, that's a whole lot of "no"s.  On the other hand we serve delicious, home cooked style food.  Minimal ingredients, organic** meat, sugar free desserts, all freshly made with a ton of veggies.  Oh & we give you the recipe of your favourite dish of the night - so you can make it at home.. Now what other "restaurant" does that? :P

#It's that simple.  Nothing is from a packet, there's no sugar, no gluten*, no soy*, no vegtable oils are used, no grains & minimal carbs.  I know, I know, that's a whole lot of "no"s.

#Most supper clubs have an extravagant menu, they have unique dishes that take time & preparation, they have fancy names with fancy ingredients - and they're awesome.  This is not that.  Our supper clubs have simple dishes with minimal ingredients that you could make at home in not a lot of time.  So why are you spending your hard earned money?
